# Short Form Content Tool
**Python tool to automate video creation process for faceless social media accounts**

# Description
With the rise of TikTok and Instagram Reels, short form content is becoming increasingly popular. It takes skill, editing software, good computers, and lots of effort to edit these videos. This tool automates the process such that the user only needs to provide several links and texts to generate the video.

TikTok, Reels, and other social media often have trending formats of videos. Currently this tool only supports 1 format. This is the typical format of having a video background with an AI voice-over reading text from the screen. The user enters the text and a youtube link to their background video. The text is usually an engaging or shocking story that hooks the viewer into the content. The background video is usually a Minecraft parkour video.

Eventually support for several other formats of videos will be added.
